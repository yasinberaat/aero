# Product Context

## Why this project exists
Aero is a personal productivity-style app that groups user activity into three primary areas:
- Finance
- Work
- Fitness

The refactor focuses on making the app feel premium and fast, with a consistent “Obsidian Black” visual identity.

## Problems it solves
- Centralize daily tracking (especially finance) in a single, simple UI.
- Provide quick entry flows (expense/income) with minimal friction.

## How it should work (high-level)
- The app opens directly into `AeroContent` (no unnecessary splash delays).
- The user navigates between the three main features (finance/work/fitness).
- The drawer provides category management and quick access.

## UX goals
- Fast startup, instant responsiveness.
- Strong hierarchy and contrast on a dark UI.
- Minimal UI noise, clear primary actions.
- Finance screen optimized for daily use: chart + quick entry + daily summary.
